<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! You've found the "Jade's About Me" page! Now you must read about Jade's background, current likes, maybe even
  some dislikes.
  Unfortunately, Jade is not very fond of writing about Me's or bios so this will likely be a short read.
  Maybe that is not so unfortunate for you. </p>

<p>Jade does not have a very interesting background at all. In fact, her parents probably lived a much more exciting and
  colorful life than she does. How two gen x wildcards created a very calm and peace seeking individual is beyond me.
  Jade mostly grew up on the straight and narrow throughout grade school, high school and even college.
  Soon after high school she followed her passion for cosmetics and started her career with MAC cosmetics.
  It's been eight long years in the makeup and arts industry and Jade is now ready to try something new and expand her
  horizons! </p>

<p>When Jade is not flexing her talented and artistic muscles at work, she's typically at home enjoying her other
  favorite pastimes.
  Which usually consists of cuddling with her dog, playing video games, painting with watercolors, or hanging out with
  her friends and family.
  Sometimes she enjoys the occasional beer or two with some friends on a night out. That's actually a lie. Jade doesn't
  even drink! However, Jade will always leave the comfort of her home if someone has proposed a sushi date of any sort.
  No beer, no alcohol, only sushi. Always sushi.</p>
