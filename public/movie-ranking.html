<h3>A Knights Tale</h3>
<p> A fun movie about a man reaching for the stars. A medieval tale with a modern twist. </p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p> This movie truly illustrates the hero's journey. </p>
It's the perfect example of what friendship, honor, and adventure amongst an unlikely group of people can look like.
